# SocialMedia
Codes and data to reproduce the results we published in our paper 

"Universality, criticality and complexity of information propagation on social media", see

https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00116

The codes in this folder can be used to reproduce the main results of our work. The three folders "percolation", "avalanches" and "data_vs_models" contain three distinct codes to perform three distinct parts of our analysis. Each code is accompained by a READ_ME file that explains how to use it. However, we also provide the notebook "weibo_full_analysis.ipynb", where we first download weibo data from the original source and create hashtags time series. Then, we use each of the three aforementioned codes to perform the full analysis and display the results.
