DESCRIPTION

This program computes the first and second moment of the largest avalanche in a sample of time series as a function of the temporal resolution used to define avalanches.


Results of the systematic analysis of time series generated by several different systems are reported in

https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00116

BASIC INSTRUCTIONS

To compile the program type "make". To run the program and perform the analysis, just type

./TS_phase_diag.out dataset

"dataset" is a string that specifies the name of the file containing the time series.

DETAILS ABOUT THE INPUT/OUTPUT PARAMETERS AND FILES


The input file MUST be structured as follows:

Na t1 t2 t3 \n
Nb t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 \n
.
.
.
Nn t1 t2 \n

where:

Na, Nb,..., Nn is an integer specifying the number of events that compose the time series a, b,..., n respectively. In the example above we would have Na=3, Nb=5, Nn=2.

t1 t2 ... is the time series, i.e., a sequence of chronologically ordered interevent times. The last interevent time, in our implementation, represents the distance between the end of the temporal window and the last event time. It thus does not represent an event and we associate a cluster of size 0 to it. If the last interevent must be considered, change line number 96 of the file `percolation_algorithm.c` from `cluster_size[K]=0;` to `cluster_size[K]=1`. 

The present implementation of the code assumes that the time series are stored in a file whose name is 

X_ts.txt

with X = dataset, the same string given in input. The code further assumes that the file is contained in the folder '..', i.e., the folder that contains the present folder. The code further assumes that the present folder contains the folder `res`, where results are stored. Results are stored in a file with name

X_PhaseDiag.txt

with X = dataset, the same string given in input. The results file contains three columns:

Temporal resolution
Average (over time series) of the size of the largest cluster
Average (over time series) of the square of the size of the largest cluster

EXAMPLE


To run the code on the WEIBO dataset, type

./TS_phase_diag.out weibo

Results of the analysis will be printed in the file

weibo_PhaseDiag.txt

The percolation strength and the associated susceptibility can be plotted as shown in the notebook "weibo_full_analysis.ipynb". The location of the maximum of the susceptibility is the optimal resolution Delta^*.
